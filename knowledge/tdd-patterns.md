```

### RED: Write a Failing Test

1. Write a test for behavior that doesn't exist yet
2. Run it — **it MUST fail**
3. If it passes, your test is wrong or the behavior already exists
4. The failure message should be clear about what's missing

```typescript
// RED - this test fails because calculateTax doesn't exist
test("calculates 10% tax on order total", () => {
  const order = { items: [{ price: 100 }] };
  expect(calculateTax(order)).toBe(10);
});
// Error: calculateTax is not defined
```

### GREEN: Make It Pass (Quickly)

1. Write the **minimum code** to make the test pass
2. Don't worry about elegance — just make it work
3. Hardcoding is fine if it makes the test pass
4. You'll clean it up in REFACTOR

```typescript
// GREEN - simplest thing that works
function calculateTax(order: Order): number {
  return 10; // hardcoded! that's fine for now
}
// Test passes ✓
```

### REFACTOR: Clean It Up

1. Tests are passing — now improve the code
2. Remove duplication
3. Improve names
4. Extract functions/classes
5. **Run tests after every change** — they must stay green

```typescript
// REFACTOR - now make it real
function calculateTax(order: Order): number {
  const total = order.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
  return total * 0.1;
}
// Tests still pass ✓
```

---

## Why This Order Matters

### RED First

- **Proves the test can fail** — a test that can't fail is worthless
- **Defines the target** — you know exactly what you're building
- **Documents intent** — the test IS the specification

### GREEN Second

- **Shortest path to working** — don't over-engineer
- **Builds confidence** — you have a safety net
- **Enables refactoring** — can't refactor without tests

### REFACTOR Third

- **Safe to change** — tests catch regressions
- **Incremental improvement** — small steps, always green
- **Design emerges** — patterns reveal themselves

---

## The Feathers Legacy Code Algorithm

When working with existing code that lacks tests:

```
1. Identify change points
2. Find test points
3. Break dependencies
4. Write tests (characterization tests first)
5. Make changes
6. Refactor
```

### Characterization Tests

When you don't know what code does, write tests that **document actual behavior**:

```typescript
// Step 1: Write a test you KNOW will fail
test("processOrder returns... something", () => {
  const result = processOrder({ id: 1, items: [] });
  expect(result).toBe("PLACEHOLDER"); // will fail
});

// Step 2: Run it, see actual output
// Error: Expected "PLACEHOLDER", got { status: "empty", total: 0 }

// Step 3: Update test to match reality
test("processOrder returns empty status for no items", () => {
  const result = processOrder({ id: 1, items: [] });
  expect(result).toEqual({ status: "empty", total: 0 });
});
// Now you've documented what it actually does
```

**Key insight**: Characterization tests don't verify correctness — they verify **preservation**. They let you refactor safely.

## Breaking Dependencies for Testability

From _Working Effectively with Legacy Code_:

### The Seam Model

A **seam** is a place where you can alter behavior without editing the source file.

```typescript
// BEFORE: Untestable - hard dependency
class OrderProcessor {
  process(order: Order) {
    const db = new ProductionDatabase(); // can't test this
    return db.save(order);
  }
}

// AFTER: Testable - dependency injection (object seam)
class OrderProcessor {
  constructor(private db: Database = new ProductionDatabase()) {}

  process(order: Order) {
    return this.db.save(order);
  }
}

// In tests:
const fakeDb = { save: jest.fn() };
const processor = new OrderProcessor(fakeDb);
```

### Common Dependency-Breaking Techniques

| Technique                    | When to Use                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Parameterize Constructor** | Class has hidden dependencies        |
| **Extract Interface**        | Need to swap implementations         |
| **Subclass and Override**    | Can't change constructor signature   |
| **Extract Method**           | Need to isolate behavior for testing |
| **Introduce Static Setter**  | Global/singleton dependencies        |

## TDD in Swarm Context

### For New Features

```
1. Coordinator decomposes task
2. Worker receives subtask
3. Worker writes failing test FIRST
4. Worker implements until green
5. Worker refactors
6. swarm_complete runs verification gate
```

### For Bug Fixes

```
1. Write a test that reproduces the bug (RED)
2. Fix the bug (GREEN)
3. Refactor if needed
4. The test prevents regression forever
```

### For Refactoring

```
1. Write characterization tests for existing behavior
2. Verify tests pass (they document current state)
3. Refactor in small steps
4. Run tests after EVERY change
5. If tests fail, you broke something — revert
```

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Overspecified Tests (THE WORST)

> "Mocks have their place, but excess mocking breaks encapsulation and tests a mechanism rather than a behavior." — Adam Tornhill, _Software Design X-Rays_

Overspecified tests are **brittle garbage** that:

- Break on every refactor even when behavior is unchanged
- Test implementation details instead of outcomes
- Create false confidence (tests pass but code is wrong)
- Make refactoring terrifying instead of safe

**Symptoms:**

```typescript
// ❌ OVERSPECIFIED - tests HOW, not WHAT
test("saves user", () => {
  const mockDb = { query: jest.fn() };
  const mockLogger = { info: jest.fn() };
  const mockValidator = { validate: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(true) };

  saveUser({ name: "Joel" }, mockDb, mockLogger, mockValidator);

  expect(mockValidator.validate).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ name: "Joel" });
  expect(mockDb.query).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    "INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?)",
    ["Joel"],
  );
  expect(mockLogger.info).toHaveBeenCalledWith("User saved: Joel");
});
// Change ANY internal detail and this test breaks
// Even if the user still gets saved correctly!

// ✅ BEHAVIOR-FOCUSED - tests WHAT, not HOW
test("saves user and can retrieve them", async () => {
  await saveUser({ name: "Joel" });

  const user = await getUser("Joel");
  expect(user.name).toBe("Joel");
});
// Refactor internals freely - test only breaks if behavior breaks
```

**The Fix:**

- Test **observable behavior**, not internal mechanics
- Ask: "If I refactor the implementation, should this test break?"
- If the answer is "no" but it would break → overspecified
- Prefer integration tests over unit tests with heavy mocking
- Mock at boundaries (network, filesystem), not between your own classes

### ❌ Writing Tests After Code

- You don't know if the test can fail
- Tests often test implementation, not behavior
- Harder to achieve good coverage

### ❌ Skipping RED

- "I'll just write the code and test together"
- You lose the specification benefit
- Tests may not actually test what you think

### ❌ Big GREEN Steps

- Writing too much code before running tests
- Harder to debug when tests fail
- Loses the feedback loop benefit

### ❌ Skipping REFACTOR

- "It works, ship it"
- Technical debt accumulates
- Code becomes legacy code

### ❌ Refactoring Without Tests

- "I'll just clean this up real quick"
- No safety net
- Bugs introduced silently

---

## What Good Tests Look Like

> "Think about letting the code in the test be a mirror of the test description." — Corey Haines, _4 Rules of Simple Design_
> `pdf-brain_search(query="test name influence test code explicit")`

### One Assertion Per Test

> "As a general rule, it's wise to have only a single verify statement in each it clause. This is because the test will fail on the first verification failure—which can often hide useful information when you're figuring out why a test is broken." — Martin Fowler, _Refactoring_
> `pdf-brain_search(query="single verify statement it clause")`

When a test with 15 assertions fails, which one broke? You're now debugging your tests instead of your code.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Multiple assertions - which one failed?
test("user registration", async () => {
  const result = await register({ email: "a@b.com", password: "12345678" });

  expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  expect(result.user.email).toBe("a@b.com");
  expect(result.user.id).toBeDefined();
  expect(result.user.createdAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);
  expect(result.token).toMatch(/^eyJ/);
  expect(sendWelcomeEmail).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(analytics.track).toHaveBeenCalledWith("user_registered");
});
// Test fails: "expected true, got false" — WHICH expectation?!

// ✅ GOOD: One behavior per test
describe("user registration", () => {
  test("returns success for valid input", async () => {
    const result = await register({ email: "a@b.com", password: "12345678" });
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  });

  test("creates user with provided email", async () => {
    const result = await register({ email: "a@b.com", password: "12345678" });
    expect(result.user.email).toBe("a@b.com");
  });

  test("generates auth token", async () => {
    const result = await register({ email: "a@b.com", password: "12345678" });
    expect(result.token).toMatch(/^eyJ/);
  });

  test("sends welcome email", async () => {
    await register({ email: "a@b.com", password: "12345678" });
    expect(sendWelcomeEmail).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
// Test fails: "user registration > sends welcome email" — IMMEDIATELY obvious
```

**Exception:** Multiple assertions on the _same_ logical thing are fine:

```typescript
// ✅ OK: Multiple assertions, one concept
test("returns user object with required fields", async () => {
  const user = await getUser(1);

  expect(user).toMatchObject({
    id: 1,
    email: expect.any(String),
    createdAt: expect.any(Date),
  });
});
```

### Arrange-Act-Assert (Given-When-Then)

> "You'll hear these phases described variously as setup-exercise-verify, given-when-then, or arrange-act-assert." — Martin Fowler, _Refactoring_
> `pdf-brain_search(query="setup exercise verify given when then arrange")`

Structure every test the same way:

```typescript
test("applies discount to orders over $100", () => {
  // ARRANGE (Given): Set up the scenario
  const order = new Order();
  order.addItem({ price: 150 });

  // ACT (When): Do the thing
  const total = order.checkout();

  // ASSERT (Then): Verify the outcome
  expect(total).toBe(135); // 10% discount
});
```

This structure makes tests **scannable**. You can glance at any test and immediately understand:

- What's the setup?
- What action triggers the behavior?
- What's the expected outcome?

### Test Names as Executable Specifications

> "A characterization test is a test that characterizes the actual behavior of a piece of code. There's no 'Well, it should do this' or 'I think it does that.' The tests document the actual current behavior." — Michael Feathers, _Working Effectively with Legacy Code_
> `pdf-brain_search(query="characterization test actual behavior document")`

Your test names should read like a spec. Someone should understand the system's behavior just by reading test names:

```typescript
describe("ShoppingCart", () => {
  test("starts empty");
  test("adds items with quantity");
  test("calculates subtotal from item prices");
  test("applies percentage discount codes");
  test("rejects expired discount codes");
  test("limits quantity to available stock");
  test("preserves items across sessions for logged-in users");
});
// This IS the specification. No separate docs needed.
```

**BDD-style naming** (Given/When/Then in the name):

```typescript
describe("checkout", () => {
  test("given cart over $100, when checking out, then applies free shipping");
  test("given expired coupon, when applying, then shows error message");
  test(
    "given out-of-stock item, when checking out, then removes item and notifies user",
  );
});
```

### Test Behavior, Not Implementation

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Tests the contract
test("cart calculates total with tax", () => {
  const cart = new Cart();
  cart.add({ price: 100 });
  cart.add({ price: 50 });

  expect(cart.totalWithTax(0.1)).toBe(165);
});

// ❌ BAD: Tests internal structure
test("cart stores items in array and calls tax calculator", () => {
  const cart = new Cart();
  cart.add({ price: 100 });

  expect(cart.items).toHaveLength(1);
  expect(cart.taxCalculator.calculate).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### The "Refactor Test"

Before committing a test, ask: **"If I completely rewrote the implementation but kept the same behavior, would this test still pass?"**

- If yes → good test
- If no → you're testing implementation details

### Mock Boundaries, Not Internals

```typescript
// ✅ Mock external boundaries
const mockFetch = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: "..." });
// Network is a boundary - mock it

// ❌ Don't mock your own classes
const mockUserService = { getUser: jest.fn() };
// This is YOUR code - use the real thing or you're not testing anything
```

### Test Names Are Documentation

```typescript
// ✅ Describes behavior
test("rejects passwords shorter than 8 characters");
test("sends welcome email after successful registration");
test("returns cached result when called within TTL");

// ❌ Describes implementation
test("calls validatePassword method");
test("uses EmailService");
test("checks cache map");
```

---

## The Mantra

```
RED    → What do I want?
GREEN  → How do I get it?
REFACTOR → How do I make it right?
```

**Never skip a step. Never change the order.**
